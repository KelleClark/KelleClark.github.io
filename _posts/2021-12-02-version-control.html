    <h2 style="text-align: center; color:#284253;">Really Commiting to Version Control</h2>


    <p> If all is well with the universe, every engineer experiences being a member of a great team at
        one point in their career. A team
        where everyone is vested and contributes. At this point, the old way of doing most of
        the work on your own to then upload and share
        with others before the presentation is no longer acceptable. It is time for version control.</p>

    <p> Most professional software development teams use some subset of
        <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org">agile</a> and <a href="https://www.devops.com">devops</a>
        principles as part of their workflow protocol and governance because
        the systems they are creating WILL be the result of the entire team's
        efforts. Collaborate with others (or going solo) on a large scale project takes more than
        programming muscle. There is a real need to be strategic, have a plan and
        use the plan. Enter Version Control.

    <p>I learned many of the following points while in school and
        first starting to use Gitlab with the lack of self-control of a kid in a candy store.
        I've since moved that entangled repository of branches to GitHub with a decision to make: scrap
        the whole thing and begin fresh or try to trim it up so that I can build on it.
        While there is no question that having the ability to roll back to a previously working code base with version
        control will save a team's backside at least once, the real kicker is using version control to
        efficiently build a project others will be able to maintain and that can easily be
        scaled. Hopefully these
        suggestions for using version control will help you out as you build on a team of one or many amazing
        engineers.

    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>
            <h4 style="text-align: center; color:#284253;">REALLY USE THE VERSION CONTROL</h4>
            <p>
                After choosing a version control system, it is essential to make sure that every teammember really uses
                the system. I know,
                this seems so basic, but the magnitude of fear of the unknown with git that is experienced is directly
                proportional to the number people who will
                know a mistake has been made. The benefits of enabling efficient, informed, simulaneous collaboration
                far outway the time investment to use one of the many options out there. "Git"-ting everyone to commit
                to committing their changes at least once a day is highly recommended. A friendly way to wade into using
                git is to use a programming environment
                like Visual Studio Code that has an extension for
                version control. This can make pushing and pulling
                changes virtually painfree. The remaining list items elaborate on what I mean by "really using" such a
                framework. `

        <li>
            <h4 style="text-align: center; color:#284253;">USE A ReadMe FILE</h4>
            <p>
                Documentation can feel like a waste of time, unless you have had the pleasure of inheriting a project
                that did not include documentation. I am not talking about anything that would require a tl;dr summary.
                Your goal could be for any capable non-team developer to be able to spend a day
                reading through the repository and be able to scale/maintain as necessary. There are many templates
                available
                and here is one that I really like: <a href="https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template">Best
                    README
                    Template</a>.</p>
            <p>A ReadMe goes a long way in the process of maintaining or scaling a project. Make sure
                that you include a good description of what
                is included in the repository and the requirements for someone to use/interact/contribute to it. As the
                project
                developes, update this information. New versions for dependencies can create a little havic, but
                there will be some hope for a project's long life if you share with others a snapshot of the environment
                where the project is known to have worked.

        <li>
            <h4 style="text-align: center; color:#284253;">ONE MAIN BRANCH</h4>
            <p> Within your project's repository, have a main branch designated for the components of the project that
                are "good to go". By this
                I mean, this branch of code has tested, documented, clean code that is, or could be, deployed for the
                end
                users. You could also have a secondary branch where any new changes are pushed to so that simply
                redirecting
                traffic with a load balancer to this second branch will enable the changes to be accessed by end users
                with virtually no down
                time.
                (blue-green deployement).

        <li>
            <h4 style="text-align: center; color:#284253;">USE #feature-fix BRANCHES</h4>
            <p>
                Have a list of features/fixes that the team is working on. You could use a kanban like framework,
                where issues are organized and progress is tracked. Once an issue is tagged and assigned, then those
                working on that issue checkout a new branch off the master (or green branch if applicable) under the
                same
                tag. Here is a nice article outlining some of the current naming conventions when creating branches:
                <a href="https://codingsight.com/git-branching-naming-convention-best-practices/">"Git Branching Naming
                    Convention Best Practices."</a>
            </p>

            <p> It is crucial that changes in one branch should only relate to the issue specified for this
                branch so that
                conflicts with other changes in the code are minimal. Also, never work on
                someone else's issue because you have a "great" idea without asking them first. You will be very
                unpopular if you do.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 style="text-align: center; color:#284253;">KEEP YOUR BRANCH UP TO DATE</h4>
            <p>
                When working locally, pull from the master and merge any changes often AND push local changes to the
                remote branch so that
                others on your team can see what changes you are making. Do not keep
                happily programming all day without pushing your changes. I learned the value of pushing my updates at
                least twice a day when I am really making progress. Resolving conflicts is no fun for anyone.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 style="text-align: center; color:#284253;"> KEEP YOUR CHANNEL OPEN</h4>
            <p>
                Even if you are remote, maybe especially if you are remote, make an effort to communicate with the
                whole
                team on your progress and issues. Please do not have an ego, meaning ask for help when you
                have hit a wall and give help without in a constructive way. I enjoy the flow of sending quick
                messages
                or emojis, but I still enjoy hearing another human voice to remind me that my teammates are not just
                AI
                bots.
                So, if a teammate is
                posting
                their progress or
                has made a code review/pull request, take
                the time to actually read the comments they included and give them some genuine feedback.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 style="text-align: center; color:#284253;">COMMIT NO SMELLY CODE</h4>
            <p>
                Try to clean up your code and update the status of your issues before code reviews. It is similar
                to company coming over. You may code (live) anyway you like, but tidy up before someone else comes to
                visit.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    I am positive that anyone who scanned this list can think of one or two more items to add, and I would love to hear
    what you
    have to teach me.
