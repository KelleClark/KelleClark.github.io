    <p> There is a need to process lakes and warehouses filled with data in order to make critical descisions
        about business, heath, politics and the list goes on. The solution requires systems that can seek out
        information effectively and quickly tell us what we need to know,
        not just what we want to know. </p>

    <p></p>Neural network architecture and machine learning algorithms are used to enable machines
    applying simple funtions to sift through the data to identify patterns. The associations learned can then
    be interpreted and utilized. Here are the key definitions:</p>

    <div>

            <li>
                <p><b>A Neural Network</b> refers to a sequence of instructions that are
                    programmed
                    and carried out by processors
                    that execute step functions or sigmoid functions organized in layers, with layers communicating
                    combined results to another layer either linearly or recursively with the goal of recognizing
                    patterns
                    and building rules for catagorizing/classifying information. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Neural networks have an input layer and an output layer, but the architechture of
                    neural networks can include hidden layers, allowing for more in-depth, <b>deep learning</b>,
                    discorvery. The
                    information flow between these layers can be
                    linear or cyclical. <it> Feed-forward neural networks</it> move information from

    <p> Since our brains are darn good at making sense of large
        amounts of
        input, it stands
        to reason that Computer Scientists and Mathematicians attempt to automate solutions to these tasks taking
        inspiration from biological nueral networks. In some use cases, the goal is for "humans" to already know the
        patterns that they are interested in or that exist within the
        data and then train a system to recognize these patterns. In the context of a system, there are known signatures
        of past attacks or bugs within similar systems. As part of security, it is essential that we efficiently
        monitor code and
        transactions
        for these signatures. However, attackers are creative and think of novel ways
        to breach
        security of a system including exploiting bugs in code. An ideal network security monitoring system would also
        be able to learn the difference
        between
        expected patterns and
        an outlying one or even identify uninteded behavior in code. A neural network could be used to identify
        unexpected behaviors of the system by using as
        input random states, an action and resulting behavior to generate an association for classifying outlying
        behavior. This rule could then be
        used to monitor the states and behaviors of the system in real time. </p>

    The need for a system to learn, or at least the
    ablility for task
    specific learning, involves
    narrow Artificial Intelligence, AI, or more specifically on the
    methods of Machine
    Learning, ML. As with
    all technologies in AI that would allow processors to exhibit intelligence, machine learning is a collection of
    approaches that synthesize the learning process of humans in machines.
    </p>
    <p>
        For now, it seems that one algorithm, a
        Convolution Neural Network or CNN, is working overtime to extend the
        capabilities of machines to see
        and
        reason
        about the world as a human brain would. Here are some quick points:</p>



    <p>
        This blog entry will be part one of a non-technical overview of CNNs as I recount what I have gleaned so far
        from visiting the amazing resources I list at the end.
    </p>

    <p> The basic idea of a neural network is to take an input stream of numeric data and generate a rule for
        cataloging
        the
        information that
        demonstrates an understanding from the learning process, i.e. when presented with new data the
        rule will allow the classification of characteristics of the signal "close" to what a human would give.
        There
        are many different designs for neural networks used with the intent to allow machines to see, hear
        and commmunicate like humans and this entry focuses on the use of CNNs as applied to Image Processing because
        the pre-process steps are
        a little more intuitive than those associated with say Natural Language Processing.
        The models take inspiration from modalities of human learning, i.e. learning information using a waterfall like
        design with the next concept building on the previous concept after it has been mastered or a cyclical learning
        approach that allows concepts to be revisited.
        As with every automated process, the desing of a CNN must address the requirements of speed, effectiveness and
        storage.
    </p>
    <p>Ok, I said that this would be a high level description, so here it goes. The discussion assumes that there
        is a large collection of data to be analyzed, thus the need to automate the process, and there is a metric
        agreed upon to measure the performance.</p>

    <p> To model the process, we start with the data itself (focusing on the image processing use case).
        The wavelengths
        constructing an image at one point in time is
        sampled at
        regular intervals from the top left of the boundary of the image to the bottom right and the measures will
        be recorded in a 2D array, think an n x m matrix, where n and m are positive integers.
        This discrete representation of
        the image
        will be an approximation to the real image and lies in our preset spatial domain.
        For black and white images, the entries are 0s and 1s and for grayscale images,
        the values are between 0 and 1 inclusive. The representation of color images
        requires a much larger number of
        possible
        combinations of values and a storage increase in the number of channels needed from the one channel used for
        black and white or grayscale images. Specifically, using RGB notation:
        (red, green, blue),
        we have three primary coponents using at minimum 8 bits per component. These values are typically scaled
        to [0,1] and operations are applied to each of these three channels seperately. </p>

    <p> Now that we have an idea of how to visualize the represention of one type of data, we begin the overview of how
        to
        create a set of steps that could allow a machine to seemingly make decisions. There are three approaches in
        machine
        learning applied to collections of data: supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods. With supervised
        learming
        techniques, images need to be
        selected from the collection as a training set, labeled and then fed into the algorithm to generate our
        association. The association can then be assessed with the remaining images. This approach comes with some
        upfront
        costs of curating a set of data that has already been classified/catagorized in order to measure the recall and
        precision
        of the algorithm. Once trained though, the algorithm can then tweaked with less effort to learn on other data
        sets.
        There are
        certainly some use cases for language or image processing where this is appropriate. As mentioned in <a
            href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265729668_Unsupervised_Classification_of_Images_A_Review">
            Unsupervised
            Image Classification: A Review</a>, if the goal is for
        AI to consume
        data indiscriminately from the web and to discover patterns as a part of rule generation, an unsupervised method
        allows for the opportunity to
        discover these patterns and
        principle components with appropriate weights. With unsupervised methods, there is no need for a training set
        but
        the requirements on time, space and computing power are more restrictive. As expected, semi-supervised methods
        combine these two approaches
        in attempt
        to strike a balance between the costs and benefits of the two.
    </p>

    <p>In any of ML methods used with data, in most cases one piece of information translates to a huge array and a some
        pre-processing
        of these representations is necessary in order to
        improve
        efficiency and accuracy. Flashback to our idea to create a mental model, a presenter will begin a talk by
        introducing
        a few key concepts in their
        slide deck to help the audience prepare for the later slides that will develop these concepts. A convolution is
        such a pre-processing
        layer, with the purpose of identifying key components. A convolution is traditionally a
        binary function taking as input the data matrix and a helper matrix known as the kernel. The operation between
        these two
        matrices is either a matrix of
        the same size as the image or slightly smaller (dimensionality reduction) dependent on the choice of kernel. We
        can say that this function filters
        the image
        with the idea to highlight aspects of the image that we are interested in. Filters are used all
        of
        the time
        in our social media and advertising to soften or sharpen images. So keeping this high level, To be honest, I
        think of this process in
        terms of a
        word
        search puzzle. My method is to start at the top left corner and look at a block of letters and then
        slide my
        gaze
        to the right until the end of the puzzle. Then I pick back up in an overlapping block of the very
        first
        one on
        the
        left side of the puzzle and continue ot move left to right down the puzzle. In the case of the
        convolution
        operation,
        a kernel is a smaller matrix that will operate on blocks of the image matrix (in the spatial domain)
        and
        then
        the convolution layer is finished off with a pooling operator. After the convolution layers are
        complete, the
        information
        will need to be taken from the spatial domain to the frequency domain by a (Fast) Fourier
        Transformation, FFT,
        to make the computations easier, and once we are done with the filtering in the frequency domain,
        find
        the
        inverse
        FFT to return to the spatial domain. Here is a great blog on filtering with convolution in the
        spatial
        domain
        and
        using FFTs to enable the use of high and low pass filters on images.
    </p>
    <p>
        With or without a convolution layer, when applying a feed-forward nerual network the ultimate goal
        to
        create a
        rule for comprehending important features of the image, we have to take a
        second to
        think about what we might consider relavent characteristics in the image. At first, it might seem
        like a
        great
        idea to
        look for specific shapes like a face or a chair. However, this process is very limiting to the
        learning
        process
        since we
        would like to generate a way of looking at never-seen-before images that could be very different
        from
        what we
        would use as a
        predetermined definition of a chair or a face. There are too many variations we would need train on
        to
        be
        practical and effective.
        So instead, we will filter images by the patterns that are common to "similar" objects and that are
        invariant
        to the
        orientation of the
        object in an image. To this point, a neural network consists of one or
        more layers of perceptrons (or more complex sigmoid
        neurons). Each perceptron will recieve information as a vector and the output of each
        perceptron's
        result is then combined and
        sent to the next layer of perceptrons. More precisely, each layer consists of applying step functions using
        weights and a bias in the case of perceptrons, sigmoid function when
        using sigmoid neurons, in parallel. Weights can be learned in this process by
        using a metric that measures correctness as compared to the known answer, with the sigmoid neurons offering more
        flexibility using small changes in
        input to result in small changes in the output. The
        metric can
        then be used to give a cost assessed when a decision is incorrect and to adjust the process with small
        tweaks
        to
        gradually
        get better (lower cost). There can be hidden layers of perceptrons sandwiched between the input layer and the
        one perceptron in the outer
        layer depending on the desired complexity of patterns to be discorvered and time.
