  excerpt: "In this project, we take the relative frequencies of various
   ngram distributions found in a training corpus then use linear and Laplacian
   smooting to build language models in order to predict the next word(s) for given
   input into the model. This work is done in a ipynb file without making minimal use of
   nltk."
