  description: "In this project, relative frequencies of
   ngrams (unigrams/bigrams/trigrams) are found in a training corpus. To fill in missing tokens (words) in 
   the distribution, the language models are smoothed using linear and Laplacian methods. 
   Given an input text, the model is used to predict the next word(s). This project uses an ipynb
    file making minimal use of nltk library."
